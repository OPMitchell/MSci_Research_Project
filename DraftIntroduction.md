# Background Information

This document provides some background into the research area of Interactive Storytelling for computer games. It defines keywords, and details notable research results and software produced as a result of discoveries made in the field. Where necessary, references have been made to pre-existing works.

## What is Interactive Storytelling?

#### Defining Interactive Storytelling

Interactive storytelling is a unique form of narrative design seen in digital entertainment mediums whereby there is no pre-determined storyline. Instead, the user is able to change the story and influence the characters themselves. Bostan and Marsh define interactive  storytelling as an approach to computer game narrative design where "real-time feedback collected from the players is used by the game engine to continuously modify the content as it is being delivered." [1]. The key aspect of interactive storytelling is that the player is an active participant and their in-game actions have a direct effect on the narrative that is told. This differs from traditional computer game narratives which typically consist of an unchanging linear story with a pre-defined outcome.

#### Criteria for an Interactive Storytelling System

Riedl identifies 3 criterion for interactive storytelling systems [2]:
1. The user actively participates, playing the role of a character and controlling a virtual avatar, or acting as an observer who has the power to make changes to the story-world and influence characters.
2. The user:
    - is told a story by a pre-defined story artifact conveyed through the medium
    - leaves the experience feeling like they have been told a story
3. The story changes as a result of a user's actions.

#### Problems with the Intergration of Interactivity into Game Narratives

Louchart et al. explain that in most computer games, attempts at complex, dynamic storylines are usually "confined to simple branching tree structures" [3]. Furthermore, as the scope of games increases and development effort is focused on assets such as textures, 3D-modelling and other gameplay content, a greater number of narrative possibilites arise. Yet the "static nature of these [tree] structures affects the range of options covered [and] reduces the framework for player interaction", an integral part of interactive storytelling. Louchart et al. go on to argue that "the integration of interactivity into game narratives requires a rethinking of the design process" because these tree-like structures either expand exponentially with the inclusion of more narrative elements (such as additional characters added to the game), or have to remain so simple and rigid that the player's immersion in the game world is threatened.

In short, with a greater amount of gameplay content comes infeasible exponential growth in the number of branches of a narrative tree structure. Developers are then forced to simplify the story, resulting in less (or no) player interactivity. This reduces player agency, and prevents the player from being immersed in a believable game-world and violates no. 3 of Riedl's criteria for an ISS [2].


#### The Narrative Paradox

It is common for narrative design in computer games to follow the Aristotelian plot-based approach, meaning that complete control over every aspect of the story is required by the author, leaving little room for interaction by the player. Louchart and Aylett recognised that the "authoring of interactive narrative presents the paradox that ... the author requires control over the unfolding narrative whilst ... the user expects freedom over their decisions." [3][4]. These two goals clearly conflict. The greater the level of interactivity provided to the player, the less control the author has over the story's events. Equally, the more control the author has over the story, the less room there is for the player to interact with characters and change the course of the narrative. This concept has been dubbed the "Narrative Paradox" [5]. Louchart and Aylett suggest that a solution to this paradox should divert from the branching plot-based approaches implemented in current computer games, hence also solving the exponential growth problem.
