### What is Interactive Storytelling?
Bostan and Marsh define interactive storytelling as an approach to computer game narrative design where "real-time feedback collected from the players is used by the game engine to continuously modify the content as it is being delivered." [1]. This differs from traditional computer game narratives which typically consist of a linear (or sometimes branching), pre-defined story. The defining aspect of interactive storytelling is that the player is an active participant and their in-game actions have a direct effect on the narrative that is told.
