## What is Interactive Storytelling?

#### Defining Interactive Storytelling

Interactive storytelling is a unique form of narrative design seen in digital entertainment mediums whereby there is no pre-determined storyline. Instead, the user is able to change the story and influence the characters themselves. Bostan and Marsh define interactive  storytelling as an approach to computer game narrative design where "real-time feedback collected from the players is used by the game engine to continuously modify the content as it is being delivered." [1]. The key aspect of interactive storytelling is that the player is an active participant and their in-game actions have a direct effect on the narrative that is told. This differs from traditional computer game narratives which typically consist of an unchanging linear story with a pre-defined outcome.

#### Criteria for an Interactive Storytelling System

O. Riedl identifies 3 criterion for interactive storytelling systems [2]:
1. The user actively participates, playing the role of a character and controlling a virtual avatar, or acting as an observer who has the power to make changes to the story-world and influence characters.
2. The user:
    - is told a story by a pre-defined story artifact conveyed through the medium
    - leaves the experience feeling like they have been told a story
3. The story changes as a result of a user's actions.

#### Problems with the Intergration of Interactivity into Game Narratives

Louchart et al. explains that in most recent computer games attempts at complex, dynamic storylines are usually "confined to simple branching tree structures" [3]. Furthermore, as the scope of games increases and development effort is focused on assets such as textures, 3D-modelling and other gameplay content, the "static nature of these structures ... reduces the framework for player interaction"; an integral part of interactive storytelling. Louchart et al. goes on to argue that "the integration of interactivity into game narratives requires a rethinking of the design process" because these tree-like structures either expand exponentially with the inclusion of more narrative elements (such as additional characters added to the game), or have to remain so simple that the player's immersion in the game world is threatened.
